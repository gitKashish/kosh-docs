## Why Kosh?

Kosh is a **local-first, encrypted password manager** built for developers, sysadmins, and privacy-focused users.  
Everything stays on your machine — no cloud, no tracking, no dependencies.

It's built with **Curve25519**, **Argon2id**, and **ChaCha20-Poly1305**, wrapped in a fast and intuitive CLI.
